# surfbot

a slack bot to check the surf

## Node version

This is deployed to AWS lambda using the v6.10.3 Javascript runtime, so I recommend using the same version locally.  Here's an example if you use NVM for version management:

```bash
nvm install v6.10.3
echo "v6.10.3" > .nvmrc
nvm use
```

## Setup

```bash
yarn install
```
